# Malakoff Excel Merge Runner

This script (and its accompanying executable `.exe` file) automates the data transfer from an SAP system output file to the IRBM template file.

## Files and Their Purpose

* `emr.py`
    This is the entry point of the script. It generates a simple user interface (UI) where you can select:
    1.  The blank template file
    2.  The data source file (from SAP)
    3.  The output folder where the final `.xlsx` file will be saved.

    It then dispatches these three file paths as arguments to Microsoft Excel and executes the macro within `Runner.xlsm`.

* `Runner.xlsm`
    This is where all the data processing happens. It is a macro-enabled Excel file containing a VBA module. This module receives the three arguments from `emr.py` and performs the data merging and processing logic.
    
    *To inspect the code, open the file and press **Alt + F11** to open the VBA editor.*

* `app.ico`
    This is the Malakoff logo icon file used to personalize the UI window generated by `emr.py`.

* `Excel Merge Runner v4.2.exe`
    This is the bundled, standalone application (version 4.2). It combines the Python script and all necessary files into a single executable. This allows end-users to run the automation **without needing to install Python** on their machines.
